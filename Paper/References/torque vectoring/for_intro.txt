The implementation of Torque Vectoring requires a control strategy capable of accurately distributing torque between individual wheels to achieve the desired yaw rate. A typical driving environment is subject to various disturbances, and due to the inability to fully sense some aspects of driving dynamics in real time, these parts remain uncertain. Therefore, the controller must ensure robustness to maintain performance under these conditions. To satisfy these requirements, this paper employs a Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) to calculate the yaw moment.
